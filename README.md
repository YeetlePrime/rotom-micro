## rotom-micro

A small framework for automatic Nintendo Switch games (mainly Pok√©mon) by emulating a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.

#### How To Use

Coming soon.

#### Compatibility

This software was only tested on the "Pro-Micro". The "Arduino Leonardo", "Arduino UNO R3" and "Teensy 2.0/Teensy 2.0++" should work aswell.
Don't forget to change the MCU type ine the makefile tho.

#### LICENSE

This project is licensed by the MIT LICENSE.
It uses the LUFA library for USB communication, so the LUFA LICENSE has to be accounted for aswell, when redistributing parts of it.

#### Inspiration

This project builds on [bertrandom's snowball-thrower project](https://github.com/bertrandom/snowball-thrower).
So thanks to him for making it publicly available.
His project is based on [progmem's switch-fightstick project](https://github.com/progmem/Switch-Fightstick).
